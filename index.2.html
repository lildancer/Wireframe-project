          <h2> I can go the distance! </h2>
            <p> I have often dreamed of a far off place
Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me
Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face
              And a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be </p>
          <p>I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
            When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h2> I will go most anywhere </h2>
            <p> Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
              It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through </p>
          <p>And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
            And my journey is complete, oh yeah </p>

        <p> Who put the glad in gladiator?
Hercules!
Whose daring deeds are great theater?
Hercules
Isn't he bold?
No one braver
Is he sweet
Our favorite flavor
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules</p>
